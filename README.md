🔐 Cybersecurity Graduate | SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst Track | Threat Detection, Monitoring, and Response

I am a cybersecurity graduate student (graduating May 2026) building hands-on capability in defensive security. My focus is security monitoring, alert triage, and incident response fundamentals, backed by practical labs in network traffic analysis and security tooling.

## 🧭 Focus Areas
- 🛰️ Security monitoring and alert triage (Security Information and Event Management concepts)
- 🧩 Threat intelligence fundamentals and indicator correlation
- 🧠 Cyber kill chain awareness for investigation thinking
- 🧪 Network traffic analysis and protocol behavior (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
- 🧾 Governance, Risk, and Compliance basics (controls, evidence, audit readiness)

## 🛠️ Practical Work (Labs and Projects)
- 🐍 Packet sniffing and spoofing labs using Python and Scapy
- 🧷 Raw socket experiments and traffic inspection workflows
- 🧰 Security event investigation write-ups with clear documentation and escalation logic
- 🧬 Deepfake detection research experiments (model comparison and evaluation)

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies
- 🐧 Linux | 🪟 Windows
- 🐍 Python | Bash
- 🌐 Wireshark | tcpdump
- ☁️ Amazon Web Services and Microsoft 365 security concepts
- 📊 Reporting and documentation for technical and non-technical audiences

## 🎯 Current Goal
Preparing for Optional Practical Training (OPT) roles in Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis, with emphasis on detection thinking, investigation discipline, and clear reporting.

## 📌 Highlights
- Strong documentation habit: every lab includes steps, results, and “what it means”
- Comfortable explaining network behaviors and security concepts clearly
- Focused on truth, repeatability, and defendable results
